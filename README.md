### Hi there, I'm Sandra ðŸ‘‹

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-b-bb217b120/)


I recently graduated with a degree in  Design and Digital Creations, and I'm now transitioning into a career in **Software Development** or **Data Analysis**. During my studies and through various **short courses**, I've built a strong foundation in:

- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Programming**: Python (for software development and data analysis)
- **Databases**: SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Basic Data Concepts**: Data cleaning, data manipulation, and data exploration


ðŸ’¼ **Current Role**:  
In my role as a Teaching Assistant, I guide students through complex technical topics and help them build strong problem-solving foundations. Along the way, Iâ€™ve enhanced my ability to communicate clearly and work effectively with othersâ€”skills that are essential in any tech-driven team.

ðŸ“‚ **What I've Worked On**:  
I've completed several **projects** during my courses that reflect my learning journey. 
These projects cover areas such as **web development**, **Python programming**, and **database management**, 
and they've allowed me to apply the concepts and technologies I've learned in a practical way.

ðŸŒ± **Next Steps**:  
Iâ€™m committed to constantly improving my skills and applying them to real-world problems. In the coming months, my focus will be on:

- Enhancing my Python skills through hands-on projects and coding challenges for both software development and data analysis.
- Gaining deeper expertise in SQL and PostgreSQL for more advanced database management and optimization.
- Participating in open-source projects and coding challenges to apply what Iâ€™ve learned and collaborate with others
